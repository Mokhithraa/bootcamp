trying add,commit, and push
created a file and trying to add that into github repo
steps:
1. new file and named text2.txt # marked automatically as U 
2. commands used:
 - cd bootcamp 
 - git status #to check out all the files and their status
 - git add text2.txt
 - git commit -m "add and commit text2.txt" #-m is for typing the commit command 
 #will hold the file in staging and not visible in github repo 
 - git push origin main #origin takes to the link and the word after origin is the branch
 


Now I'll modify in VS and add, commit and push to github
 - in VS, type the code or text2
 - after edit, M will appear as status meaning its modified
 - then the same commands
